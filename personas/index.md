# Personas

In Privilege Manager, Personas are collections of privileges for specific roles at an organization. You can assign Personas to users on a specific Computer Group to elevate their identity to perform specific tasks.

For example: A “SQL Administrator” Persona might be created that assigns rights to launch Certificate Manager and SQL Server Configuration Manager. Only users under this Persona would be allowed to execute these applications on your network.

## Viewing your Personas

To see all your Personas navigate to __Admin | Personas__. From the Windows Privilege Personas page, you can create new Personas and manage existing Personas.
