# Creating a Persona

To create a Persona, click Add New Persona from the Personas page. You will be presented with a dropdown list of Persona Templates to choose from.

| Custom Persona | Empty Persona |
| ----- | ----- |
| Network Administrators Persona | Elevate DHCP, DNS, and NLB Configuration |
| Security Administrators Persona | Elevate Local User and Groups and Group Policy Object Editor |
| SQL Administrators Persona | Elevate Certificate Manager, ODBC Configuration, and SQL Server Configuration Manager |
| Storage Administrators Persona | Elevate Disk Defrag, Disk Management, ISCSI Connection Configuration, Quota Management, Shared Folders, and Windows Backup |

Select a Persona Template and then provide a Name and Description. Once you are ready to proceed, click Create. If you selected any Persona Template other than Custom Persona then you will have pre-populated Behaviors that you can choose to delete or keep. Otherwise, you will start with a blank Persona.
