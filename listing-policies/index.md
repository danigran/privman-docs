# Listing Policies

In Application Control, layered Policies create the backbone, or parameters, that dictate precisely how privileges are accessed across your network. They define what a user can run, and where. A policy is made up of customizable filters that apply an action to specific Computer Groups. In other words, each policy is defined by:

* Filters - What criteria needs to be met to apply this policy?
* Targets - Where should this policy be applied?
* Actions - What should happen to the applications this policy applies to? (i.e. blocked, allowed, etc.)

During the creation of a Policy you will specify Actions and Targets, but Filters are created separately and then assigned to Policies.
