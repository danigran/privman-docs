# Request Application Installation

If you want to install an application on your macOS system that has not be set up for applications to self-elevate or that has not been previously approved via other downloaded policies, a request can be sent for approval. For this to work, your endpoint must be online.

If the system is offline, refer to the Offline Approval process documentation.

1. Mount the DMG containing the application you’d like to install to Applications. If the DMG contains an application bundle that can be dragged to the Applications folder, do so. If the DMG contains an installer application, double-click and proceed with the steps outlined in installing an application.
2. The Authentication required dialog opens:
